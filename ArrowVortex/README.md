# ArrowVortex

ArrowVortex is a simfile editor for Windows. It can be used to create or edit stepfiles for various rhythm games, such as StepMania, ITG, osu!, and other games which support DDR-style and/or PIU-style panel layouts.

This is a continuation of the original project by Bram 'Fietsemaker' van de Wetering. He has graciously allowed for the open sourcing of this code so that development can continue.
