# Unified StepMania Vision

## The Ultimate Goal
To create the definitive, universal rhythm game platform that unifies the fragmented StepMania ecosystem. "Unified StepMania" aims to integrate the best features from all major forks (ITGMania, Etterna, OutFox, NotITG) and official franchises (DDR, ITG, PIU) into a single, cohesive, community-driven experience.

## Core Pillars
1.  **Universality:** A single engine that supports all playstyles—Arcade, Stamina, Tech, Modding (NotITG), and Keyboard Competitive (Etterna).
2.  **Economy & Progression:** A persistent layer of engagement featuring a virtual economy (Bobcoin), a marketplace for assets, and a fitness tracking career mode (Gym).
3.  **Modern Connectivity:** Seamless online multiplayer, real-time leaderboards (Tournament), and live spectator tools.
4.  **Legacy Compatibility:** Absolute backward compatibility with Simfiles, Themes, and Lua scripts from SM5.0/5.1.
